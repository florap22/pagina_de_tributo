<p>
                In 1905, as an unknown young physicist 
                employed at the Berne Patent Office,
                he published his theory of special relativity.<br><br>
                ☛ In 1915, he presented the theory of general
                relativity, in which he completely reformulated
                the concept of gravity. One of the consequences
                was the emergence of the scientific study of
                the origin and evolution of the universe by 
                the branch of physics called cosmology.
                <br><br>
                ☛Einstein spent his last years searching for one
                of the most important theories in physics,
                the so-called unified field theory.
                The events of World War I pushed Einstein to
                engage politically, taking sides. He had contempt
                for violence, bullying, aggression, and injustice.
                <br><br>
                ☛Einstein declared himself an agnostic, and sometimes
                also declared himself an atheist, although some
                historians deny this point.
                <br><br>
                ☛During World War II, Einstein partially 
                renounced pacifism by proposing that the United States
                build a nuclear bomb before Nazi Germany, but publicly
                warned of the dangers of nuclear war and advocated
                international control of such weapons.
